# PlateMath - Website for Personal Fitness, Workout, and Nutrition Management
> Written by Lewis Kim

### Description

PlateMath is a Flask-based website that acts as a user's fitness coach, personal trainer, and nutritionist. Users are able to view and manage their daily macronutrient goals, keep track of a meal log, analyze their workouts and training data, set up workouts with other people, and much more. Users also have access to a growing exercise database, and a library of well-organized resources for workouts and nutrition, both introductory and advanced.

This website is currently in development, with the workouts and nutrition pages mostly implemented.
